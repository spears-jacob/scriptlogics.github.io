                        Hi, I'm Jacob Spears and I'm a Business Intelligence professional with over a decade of data and technical writing experience.
                        I've spent my career as a data engineer across several platforms and services, including SQL Sever, AWS, DBT, Hadoop/Hive, and many more.
                        During that time, I've excelled in data quality and documentation, and want to bring that expertise to your organization.<b>
                        I believe in collaboration, innovation, and excellence. I work closely with clients to understand their unique
                        challenges and goals, developing customized solutions that deliver tangible results. With a commitment to quality and
                        attention to detail, I strive to exceed expectations and drive success for every project I undertake.
